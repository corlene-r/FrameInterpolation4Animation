This project showcases an extension of RIFE for applications in animation. For a this project submission and talk of the underlying theory, read `FrameInterpforAnimation.pdf`. 

To see a log I've written of development, check out `corlene_notes.md`. This will also include my log of packages needed for install, though theoretically `requirements.txt` should work. 

If you'd like to read RIFE's original readme, check out `RIFE-README.md`

If you'd like to see the trained models, check out the `final_models` folder. They will be ready to run. 

Alternatively, if you'd like to generate the example images in the paper, try running the shell script `get_all_model_outputs.sh`

Thanks for checking this out :>
