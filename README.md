This project showcases an extension of RIFE for applications in animation. For a this project submission and talk of the underlying theory, read `FrameInterpforAnimation.pdf`. 

To see a log I've written of development, check out `corlene_notes.md` (tbh it's a better README than my README). This will also include my detailed description of packages needed for install and bugs I ran into, though theoretically `requirements.txt` should work on its own. 

If you'd like to read RIFE's original readme, check out `RIFE-README.md`. This repo is forked from https://github.com/hzwer/ECCV2022-RIFE 

If you'd like to see the trained models, check out the `final_models` folder. They will be ready to run using `inference_img.py`

Alternatively, if you'd like to generate the example images in the paper, try running the shell script `get_all_model_outputs.sh`

Thanks for checking this out :>
